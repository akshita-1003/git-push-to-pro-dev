## 📌 What is this repo?

`git-push-to-pro-dev` is my public **learning diary and practical documentation** of everything I explore about **Git** and **GitHub** — from scratch to mastery.

This is not just a notes repo — it's a **developer's field manual** with:

- ✅ Real mistakes and how I fixed them  
- ✅ Clean, structured notes with visual diagrams  
- ✅ Real-world Git commands and use-cases  
- ✅ Workflows, experiments, best practices  
- ✅ Tips, traps, mental models & weekly learning logs

## 🔥 Why This Exists

Most Git tutorials are either too basic or too theoretical. I wanted a **practical, evolving repository** that shows:

- What actually happens when you run certain Git commands  
- Why Git can feel confusing — and how to make it intuitive  
- How version control works in real team environments

> 📖 Think of this repo as the missing link between docs, Stack Overflow, and real experience.

- Learning the core workflow: `init` → `add` → `commit` → `push`  
- Building mental models for staging area, commits, branches, and remote  
- Documenting every mistake, fix, and experiment in this repo  
- Exploring GitHub: repos, commits, issues, pull requests, and collaboration  
- Practicing daily by using Git in real or mock projects

📅 This foundation phase will run for the next few weeks as I build deep intuition.
