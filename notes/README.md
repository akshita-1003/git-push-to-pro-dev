# 📒 Git & GitHub Notes

Welcome! 👋  
This folder contains **my personal notes** as I begin learning **Git** and **GitHub** from scratch.

I’ve just started, and I’ll keep updating this as I learn more.  
These notes are simple, beginner-friendly, and written in my own words to help me (and maybe you too!) understand version control better.

## 📌 What's Inside (So Far)

- 📘 Simple explanation of **Git** and **GitHub**  
- ⚙️ Configuring Git (`git config --global`)  
- 🧰 Basic Git commands:
  - `git clone`
  - `git status`
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git push`

More will be added as I continue learning! 🚀

## 🎯 Purpose

- To build a strong understanding of how version control works using Git  
- To document my learning journey in a clear and organized way  
- To create a personal reference I can revisit whenever needed  
- To help other beginners who are starting their Git & GitHub journey  
- To develop habits of writing clean notes and maintaining good developer practices from day one
