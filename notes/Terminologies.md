## 📁 Repository (Repo)

A **repository** is like a folder where we upload and manage our code.

## ✅ Commit

**Committing** means finalizing the changes made in the code.

It is a **two-step process**:
1. **Add** the change  
2. **Commit** it

> 🔁 In **Git**, we follow both the steps: `add` ➝ `commit`.  
> ⚡ In **GitHub**, we can directly commit changes via the browser.

🧠 **Note:** Git and GitHub save the history of a project in the form of **commits**.
